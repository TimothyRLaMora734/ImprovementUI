# Improvement UI for macOS Mojave and Catalina.
(only to Unsupported Macs)


# What is this?

A cosmetic improvement for the windows and popovers corners (and shadows) that has been updated to the API Metal.  

# Notes

The ImprovementUI application is helper. Through it, updated files are downloaded and informs the specifications of both modes (Transparent and Opaque)

If the ImprovementUI application cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer: 
System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Open Anyway (button)

If the downloaded application (UI_Opaque or UI_Transparent) cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer: 
System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General and allow app to run

The mask for the window corners has been updated to Metal. Therefore, the corners will not be perfectly rounded. But windows and popovers will be shown correctly with the shadow.
